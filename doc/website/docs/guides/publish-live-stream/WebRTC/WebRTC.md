# WebRTC publishing

Ant Media Server can ingest your streams with WebRTC to make sure that you deliver a real-time streaming experience with minimal latency.Â 

Steps for WebRTC publishing:

## Navigate to the publish page

Visit ```https://your_domain_name:5443/WebRTCAppEE``` in the Enterprise Edition or ```https://your_domain_name:5443/WebRTCApp``` in the Community Edition. 

If you're running Ant Media Server on your local computer, you can also visit ```http://localhost:5080/WebRTCAppEE``` in the Enterprise Edition or ```http://localhost:5080/WebRTCApp``` in the Community Edition.
